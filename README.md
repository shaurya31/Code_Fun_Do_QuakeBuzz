# Code_Fun_Do_QuakeBuzz
Earthquakes occur quite frequently in Assam and as we are studying in Assam we thought of doing something for this.
We are planning to make a Earthquake detection sensor for campus which uses P waves of earthquake for detection before the strike. So basically we are using the fact that whenever an earthquauke comes, there are two types of waves:
1.) P wave or the primary wave
2.) S wave or the secondary wave
The time difference between these two waves is roughly 2 minutes, and if we can get earthquake's warning 2 minutes prior to it, we can save many lives.
We are planning to use SW-420 vibration sensor module and our hardware will have multi level architecture with leaves getting data from the module and each level will have a certain threshold on the amplitude and frequency of vibrations to very intelligently distinguish between noise and a real earthquake. We are reading about earthquakes and have already got much data that will help us in setting the threasholds.
Also the whole apparatus will work very efficiently and will cost no more than 500 ruppes and thus will be affordable for the general public as well.
